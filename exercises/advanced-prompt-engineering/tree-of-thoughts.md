# Tree of Thoughts

## Summary

The AI explores multiple reasoning paths (like branches on a tree), self-evaluates, and chooses the best solution. Itâ€™s deeper, more strategic thinking.

## Example use case

Evaluate multiple insurance plans (differing in cost and benefit), and recommend the one with the most balanced value based on customer profile.

## Prompt


```
We have two plans:
Plan A: higher cost, wide coverage.
Plan B: lower cost, basic coverage.
Generate possible customer thoughts as branches and then decide which plan to recommend.
